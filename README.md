🔐 Secure Login Validation (Java)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-based Java application that simulates a secure login and entry validation system.
It validates user input based on multiple real-world conditions such as username length, password strength, age eligibility, and ID verification.

The project demonstrates core Java fundamentals, input handling, conditional logic, and boolean control flow.

🚀 Features

Username validation (minimum character length)

Password strength validation

Age eligibility check

ID verification requirement

Uses a boolean flag for secure access control

Clear success and failure messages

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Scanner class for user input

Conditional statements

Boolean logic

📂 Program Logic

The program follows these validation steps:

Checks if the username has the required length

Verifies password length for basic security

Ensures the user meets the minimum age requirement

Confirms the presence of a valid ID

Grants access only if all conditions are satisfied

If any condition fails, access is denied.
